Hello this project was created by my team during the last year of Engineering.

We build it with help of some tutorials and articles. The aim was to learn how to build a NFT Marketplace.
We where new to Web3 and Smart Contracts we focused fully on it.

The Project is deployed on Vercel - https://nft-marketplace-v1-ashy.vercel.app/
