Hello this project was created by my team during the last year of Engineering.

We build it with help of some tutorials and articles. The aim was to learn how to build a NFT Marketplace.
We where new to Web3 and Smart Contracts we focused fully on it.

The Project is deployed on Vercel - https://nft-marketplace-v1-ashy.vercel.app/

HOW DOES A NFT MARKETPLACE WORK 

An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace is a platform that enables the creation, buying, selling, and trading of unique digital assets, such as art, collectibles, and in-game items. Step-by-step overview of how an NFT marketplace typically works:

1. Creation of NFTs:  Artists, creators, or collectors create digital assets (e.g., images, videos, 3D models) and mint them as NFTs on a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Tezos, Flow).  Each NFT is assigned a unique identifier, ensuring its scarcity and authenticity.

2. Listing on the Marketplace:  Creators list their NFTs for sale on the marketplace, providing metadata (e.g., title, description, price).  Marketplaces may charge listing fees, commission rates, or both.

3. Search and Browsing:  Users can search for NFTs by category, keyword, or creator.  Marketplaces often feature curated collections, trending items, and recommendations.

4. Buying and Selling:  Buyers browse and select NFTs they’re interested in purchasing.  Marketplaces facilitate transactions, ensuring secure and transparent exchanges.  Buyers pay the listed price in cryptocurrency (e.g., Ether, Tezos) or fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR) through the marketplace’s payment gateway.

5. Smart Contracts:  Each NFT is linked to a smart contract, which automates the transfer of ownership and ensures the NFT’s scarcity and authenticity.  Smart contracts also govern the terms of the sale, such as royalties for creators and fees for the marketplace.

6. Wallet Integration:  Buyers and sellers need to have a compatible cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) to interact with the marketplace.  Wallets store and manage the user’s cryptocurrencies, ensuring secure transactions.

7. Marketplace Fees:  Marketplaces generate revenue through various fees: + Listing fees: charged for creating a listing. + Commission rates: taken from the sale price (typically ranging from 5% to 20%). + Transaction fees: charged for each sale or transfer (typically ranging from 0.1% to 1%).

8. Ongoing Maintenance:  Marketplaces continuously monitor and update their platforms to ensure: + Security and stability. + Scalability and performance. + Compliance with regulatory requirements.
